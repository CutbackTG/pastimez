**Installation**
If youâ€™d like to clone the project and work locally, follow these steps:

**Clone the repository:**

- Copy
`git clone https://github.com/cutbacktg/pastimez.git`
Navigate to the project directory:

- Copy
`cd pastimez`
Open index.html in a web browser to view the site.

**Deployment**

This section guides you through the process of deploying your web application to Github Pages from your project repository.

**Pre-requisites:**
- A github account.
- A github repository or clone of your web project already pushed to it.

**Step 1: Prepare Your Repository**
Check that your project is in a GitHub repository. If you haven't already created one, follow these steps:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub:
- Go to GitHub and log in.
- Click the + icon at the top-right of the page and select New repository.
- Name your repository (e.g., infernal-festival).
- Make sure to initialize the repository with a README file (optional).
- After creating the repository, you will see instructions to push an existing project.

2. Push your local project to Github (if you haven't already done so):
If you have an existing project:
- Open your terminal or command line and navigate to the project folder.

Use the following commands to push your project to Github:

- `git init`  # If your project isn't already a Git repository
- `git add .` # Add all files to the staging area
- `git commit -m "Initial commit"`  # Commit the changes
- `git branch -M main`  # Rename your default branch to 'main'
- `git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/pastimez.git`  # Replace with your repository URL
- `git push -u origin main`  # Push to GitHub

**Step 2: Enable Github Pages**

1. Navigate to the settings on your repository page on Github.
- Open the repository on Github.
- Click on the ***settings*** tab located in the top menu of your repository.

2. Find the Github Pages section:
- Scroll down until you find the ***Github Pages*** section under the ***Code and automation*** category.

3. Choose a source branch for deployment:
- In the ***Source*** dropdown, select the branch you want to deploy (usually ***main*** or ***master***)
- After selcting your branch, Github Pages will automatically start building and deploying the website

4. Select the root folder (if necessary):
- Usually the root folder will be enough. However, if you have your site in a specific folder (like ***/docs*** etc), choose that folder instead.
- If your website's ***index.html*** file is in the root of your repository, no folder selection is necessary.

5. Save the changes:
 - After selecting the branch and folder (if applicable), Github will begin deploying your site. This may take several minutes depending upon the size of your site.

 **Step 3: Access your live website**

 Once Github Pages has finished building your site, you can access it via a URL.

 1. Find your Github Pages URL:
 - In the ***Github Pages*** section under ***settings***, you will see a URL that will look like:
 https://yourusername.githuib.io/pastimez/ 
 - This URL is your live website (as stated previously, this may take a minute or two to appear, simply refresh the page periodically until it appears on the page)
 - Click the link to open your deployed website in your browser.

 **Step 4: Updating your website**

 Any time you make updates or changes to your project (e.g., editing HTML, CSS, or JavaScript), follow these steps to update your live website:

 1. Make changes to your project locally
 - Edit your files as needed in your local project directory as normal.

 2. Commit your changes in your Terminal or command line.
 - `git add .` (adds all changed files)
 - `git commit -m "Update website content"` (Commits your changes)

 3. Push the changes to Github:
 - `git push origin main` (Push to Github main branch)

 4. Wait for Github Pages to rebuild the site:
 - After pushing your changes, Github Pages will automatically rebuild your site with your new content.
 - Refresh the live URL to view your changes.

**Step 5: Troubleshooting**

Site not showing up after deployment?

- Double-check that your index.html file is in the root directory of your repository. GitHub Pages needs this file to display your website.
- Check for typos in your file names or references to other resources (like CSS or JS files).
- Make sure you've committed and pushed all your files to the repository.

Assets (images, CSS, etc.) not loading correctly?

- Ensure the file paths for your assets are correct. GitHub Pages is case-sensitive, so make sure file names are properly capitalized.

**Usage**

Once the site is open in your browser, users can:

Browse the site: View the event site, see the band line-up, contact for information on tickets and camping for the event and view the gallery of previous event photography.
